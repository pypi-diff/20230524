 The `include_package` field needs to include the `tango_mlflow` package to use `tango-mlflow` functionality.
 
 Remember to replace `your_experiment_name` with the name of your specific experiment.
 
+To log runs remotely, set the `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` environment variable to a tracking serverâ€™s URI like below:

+```shell
+export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://mlflow.example.com

 ## Functionalities
 
 ### Logging metrics into MLflow
 
 The `tango-mlflow` package provides the `MLflowStep` class, which allows you to easily log the results of each step execution to MLflow.

 In the example above, the `TrainModel` step inherits from `MLflowStep`.
 Inside the step, you can directly record metrics to the corresponding MLflow run by invoking `self.mlflow_logger.log_metric(...)`.
 
-Please note, this functionality must be used in conjunction with MLFlowWorkspace.

 ### Summarizing Tango run metrics
 
 You can specify a step to record its returned metrics as representative values of the Tango run by setting the class variable `MLFLOW_SUMMARY = True`.
 This feature enables you to conveniently view metrics for each Tango run directly in the MLflow interface

 Please note the following requirements:
 - The return value of a step where `MLFLOW_SUMMARY = True` is set must always be `dict[str, float]`.
 - You don't necessarily need to inherit from `MLflowStep` to use `MLFLOW_SUMMARY`.

 `tango-mlflow` also provides the `tango-mlflow tune` command for tuning hyperparameters with [Optuna](https://optuna.org/).
