+[Sophia: A Scalable Stochastic Second-order Optimizer for
+Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14342.pdf)
 
 Sophia is an second order clipped stochastic optimization algorithm that uses an inexpensive stochastic estimate of the diagonal of the Hessian as an pre-conditioner and a clipping mechanism to control the worst case update size. It achieves better performance than adam in terms of validation pre-traing loss, total compute, and wall-clock time. By cutting model training cost in half, Sophia can help save millions if not billions of dollars in computational resources.
 
+
 ## Benefits
 
 Sophia achievs the same validation pre training loss with 50% fewer number of steps than Adam
 
 50% less total compute and 50% less wall-clock time
 
 Seamless integration into existing training pipelines -- plug in and play!
 
 No special requirments on model architecture or computing infrastructure
 
 Supports both Hutchinson and Gauss-Newton-Bartlett Hessian Estimators

+# Roadmap
+The following roadmap outlines the future development plans for the Sophia optimizer. The roadmap is divided into three stages: short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals.
+
+
+## Short-term Goals
+
+Ready to train plug in and play file with your own model or Andromeda
+
+Performance improvements: Investigate and implement potential performance improvements to further reduce training time and computational resources -> Decoupled Sophia + heavy metric logging + Implement in Triton and or Jax?
+
+Additional Hessian estimators: Research and implement other Hessian estimators to provide more options for users.
+
+Hyperparameter tuning: Develop a set of recommended hyperparameters for various use cases and model architectures.
+
+# Mid-term Goals
+Integration with Andromeda model: Train the Andromeda model using the Sophia optimizer and compare its performance with other optimizers.
+
+Sophia optimizer variants: Explore and develop variants of the Sophia optimizer tailored for specific tasks, such as computer vision, multi-modality AI, and natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
+
+Distributed training: Implement support for distributed training to enable users to train large-scale models using Sophia across multiple devices and nodes.
+
+Automatic hyperparameter tuning: Develop an automatic hyperparameter tuning module to help users find the best hyperparameters for their specific use case.
+
+# Long-term Goals
+Training multiple models in parallel: Develop a framework for training multiple models concurrently with different optimizers, allowing users to test and compare the performance of various optimizers, including Sophia, on their specific tasks.
+
+Sophia optimizer for other domains: Adapt the Sophia optimizer for other domains, such as optimization in reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms.
+
+
+By following this roadmap, we aim to make the Sophia optimizer a powerful and versatile tool for the deep learning community, enabling users to train their models more efficiently and effectively.
+
+
+# Epoch 1 - Decoupled Sophia
+
+The DecoupledSophia optimizer offers several benefits that can help accelerate training speed and improve the flexibility of the optimization process:
+
+Modularity: Decoupling the Hessian estimation from the main optimizer allows users to easily plug in different Hessian estimators without modifying the core optimizer code. This modularity makes it easier to experiment with various Hessian estimation techniques and find the best one for a specific task.
+
+Ease of experimentation: With a decoupled architecture, researchers and practitioners can develop and test new Hessian estimators independently from the optimizer. This can lead to faster innovation and the discovery of more efficient Hessian estimation methods, which can further accelerate training speed.
+
+Customization: Users can create custom Hessian estimators tailored to their specific use cases or model architectures. This customization can potentially lead to better optimization performance and faster training times.
+
+Improved maintainability: Separating the Hessian estimation from the optimizer makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand. This can lead to faster bug fixes and improvements in the optimizer's performance.
+
+By offering these benefits, DecoupledSophia can help users accelerate training speed and improve the overall optimization process. The modular design allows for easy experimentation with different Hessian estimators, which can lead to the discovery of more efficient techniques and ultimately faster training times.
